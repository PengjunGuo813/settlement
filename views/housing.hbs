    <h1>House Types in Canada</h1>
    <p>Explore different types of houses for your consideration:</p>

    <div class="house-type">
      <h2>Condos</h2>
      <p class="house-type-description">
        Condos, short for condominiums, are individually owned units within a larger building or complex.<br>They offer a
        blend of homeownership and shared amenities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="house-type">
      <h2>Apartments</h2>
      <p class="house-type-description">
        Apartments are rented units within a building or complex.<br> They provide the convenience of living in a shared
        space without the responsibilities of homeownership.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="house-type">
      <h2>Townhouses</h2>
      <p class="house-type-description">
        Townhouses are multi-level homes that are attached to neighboring units.<br> They typically have their own entrance 
        and outdoor space, and often come with shared amenities like a clubhouse or park.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="house-type">
      <h2>Single-family Homes</h2>
      <p class="house-type-description">
        Single-family homes are standalone houses designed for one family. <br>They offer more privacy and space but also
        come with higher costs and maintenance responsibilities.
      </p>
