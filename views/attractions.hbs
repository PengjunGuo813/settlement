        <div>
            <p>The second largest country in the world, Canada has no shortage of beautiful landscapes and interesting sights for travelers to explore. From coast to coast to coast, the country is home to vibrant and culturally rich cities, along with incredible natural wonders.</p>
            <p>In Western Canada, the Rocky Mountains; the Okanagan Valley; and the cities of Vancouver, Victoria, and Calgary are some of the best places to visit and frequently dominate itineraries. In Central Canada, Niagara Falls, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec City are some of the most popular tourist destinations.</p>
            <p>Off the beaten path, but equally impressive, is Canada's North, where great rivers flow out to the Arctic Ocean, creating some incredible territory for canoeists, and where polar bears can be seen in the wild. Travelers can explore the remote beauty of places like Nahanni National Park; Great Slave Lake; and the towns and cities of Churchill, Whitehorse, and Yellowknife.</p>
            <p>For ideas to help plan your travels, see our list of top tourist attractions in Canada.</p>

                        Niagara Falls is Canada's most famous natural attraction, bringing in millions of visitors each year. Located just over an hour's drive from Toronto, along the American border, these massive falls drop approximately 57 meters. You can see the falls at an astoundingly close distance from several key points.

                        Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge have been attracting tourists and daredevils for well over a century. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries there were numerous attempts to plunge over the falls in various types of homemade boats and barrels. This, along with tightrope walkers and other spectacles, led to the adjacent town of Niagara Falls developing a carnival type atmosphere that still persists today.

                        Ottawa's Parliament Hill stands high above the Ottawa River and is graced by the Neo-Gothic-style Parliament buildings built in the last half of the 19th century. The most prominent feature is the Peace Tower, which divides the House of Commons and the Senate on either side. In front of the Parliament buildings is the Centennial Flame, lit in 1966 to commemorate the centenary of the Canadian Confederation, and behind the buildings is a sculpture garden.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the summer, the Changing of the Guard takes place on the front lawn of the Houses of Parliament, weather permitting. Below Parliament Hill, a lovely walk runs alongside the Ottawa River.

                    <p>
                        One of Canada's most unique attractions is the polar bear migration that sees these beautiful creatures make their way from land out onto the ice in Hudson Bay, near the town of Churchill in Northern Manitoba.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This small community opens itself up to tourists each fall. Tours take visitors out in tundra buggies with caged windows for close encounters with the polar bears. The prime viewing time occurs in October or November while the bears are waiting for the water to freeze before heading out onto the ice.
                    </p>
                    <span><b>Address:</b> Churchill, Manitoba, Canada</span><br />
                    <span><b>Fees:</b>To view polar bears in Churchill, visitors typically join guided tours or expeditions offered by various tour operators. These tours usually include transportation, accommodations, meals, and guided polar bear viewing experiences. The fees for these tours can vary depending on factors such as the duration of the trip, the level of accommodation, and the specific tour operator.

                    <p>
                        Although it is less than a two-hour ferry ride from the mainland, Vancouver Island can seem a world away. Most people head to Victoria, BC's capital city, for sightseeing and culture, but if you head north into the wild and remote landscapes, the island holds some unexpected and unforgettable experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nature lovers can hit the best hiking trails on Vancouver Island and set themselves up at some beautiful camping locations. Those looking for more comfort can always turn to one of the island's lodges or resorts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the island's most incredible sights are the old-growth forests of giant trees, some more than 1,000 years old. Within day-tripping distance of Victoria are the ancient trees of Eden Grove, near the town of Port Renfrew. If you are heading up island, you can also wander through Cathedral Grove, not far from the town of Port Alberni, or go all the way out to Tofino to see even more huge trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other destinations around the Island, include Nanaimo, Parksville, and Qualicum Beach, all on the eastern shore, looking out onto the Salish Sea. If you really want to get away from it all, head up to the far north of the island and explore Cape Scott Provincial Park.
                    </p>
                    <span><b>Address:</b> Province of British Columbia, Canada</span><br />
                    <span><b>Fees:</b>There are no general fees to visit downtown Victoria. However, specific attractions within the city, such as the Royal BC Museum or Butchart Gardens, may have their own entrance fees.

                        Few Canadian cities have done such a beautiful job of developing their waterfront area as Victoria and its Inner Harbour. This is a great place for strolling, relaxing, shopping, dining, and watching street performers all against the backdrop of the harbor.

Over the years, the Empress has welcomed kings and queens and, today, features a traditional high tea, which is one of the highlights for many visitors coming to Victoria. While the harbor area is popular year-round, it is particularly lively during the summer months.
